Lab 2, Part 1

Fuzz 1:
For the first fuzz, I knew it was going to take brute force
to get the answer.  So in my program, I used a for loop
starting from 0 and ending at INT MAX and checked that the
response that got returned was "success!".  Each time through
the loop, if the response had been "try again!", I would 
print the response to the console.  This was so that I would
see the progress being made.  The correct input is 34393.

Fuzz 2:
I knew that I needed to find a pattern to find the second 
number because I was warned that the answer was going to be
significantly bigger than the first fuzz. So in Chrome, I 
looked in the Network section in the developer tools to see
the response times for each number.  I found a pattern where
every multiple of 103 returned ~2 ms, while others took
longer.  Som in my program, I checked every multiple of 103
starting from 0. I did this a little bit at a time because
the server had been unreliable.  The correct input is 1010564106.

Fuzz 3:
I also found a pattern in the third fuzz where the response
times for every 100 were the same.  For example, input=0,100,200,...
had the same response times, and so did input=1,101,201,...
and so on.  But it was input=48,148,248,... where I noticed 
that the response times were much less than the others: ~2 ms.
So, I checked starting from 48 and incrementing by 100 thereafter.
The correct input is 1018841148.
